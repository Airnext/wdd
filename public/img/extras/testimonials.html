                I attended both WDD 1.0 & 2.0, delightful, encouraging and corrective information was given. Bunmi Teru interviewed me for internship slots as I was looking for a place for my One year OND IT. I was sent to Lotus Beta. WDD 2.0 I was sent to my present place of work Swifta. I would recommend to my friends andyday infact buying tickets this year for some of my friends. I have since been working and grateful to AVA for the opportunity.

                My experience of the last WDD 2.0 was very educative and had fun learning new things. A friend of mine invited me to the program and my highlight of the day was the breakout sessions. The facilitators were passionate about the topics they delivered and presentation was straightforward. Furthermore the content of the time was very okay. I am buying tickets for 3 friends for the 3.0 infact I am decided to volunteer in organizing the program this year.

                My experience with WDD 2.0 was awesome !!!!!!! I have been a follower of AVA so I follow everything they do. I learnt about networking, xollaboration, thinking outside the box, team work. The facilitators all were wonderful and well organized and they gave details about their presentation with huge career opportunities. I got my job through Alfred & Victoria Associates one month after the program.  I have purchased 8 tickets already for the youth in my church. We were taught to give back. Thank you AVA!!!!!

                WDD 2.0 was an opener  for me and it was wonderful experience. Tayo convinced me to attend the program and part pf the experience I gathered from the seminar was how to work as a team and being a leader too. My greatest highlight for me was the after event counselling anchored by Bunmi Teru, she identifed areas where I cpuld explore, she made realise the value of volunteering as my volunteer experience paved way for me to be interviewd at Mainone and untlimately the job. I have picked on with my career and being conscious to improve daily. I would definitely recommend to my friends.

                My WDD 1.0 experience was great and educative and thus helped me to learn how to build my cv well as I was given a template to work with. I had the chance of meeting a career counsellor who helped to map out my career path. My brother introduced me to the program. The facilitators are like role models, they have achieved alot and this inspired me the content and time was okay,they kept following up for guidance. AVA has been doing good for now and think they should keep it up......

                I registered for WDD 2.0 but unfortunately I couldnt make the event. I applied for a project management role via AVA just immediately after my passing out parade. I attended Interview with the guidance of the AVA team who ensured and followed through the intervoew process with me. I attended the interview at Mainone and job the one year internship job. That was a year ago and it has been an eventful and explosive experience, the position was for a year but eight months into the program I was offered a permanent role in the company where I am currently learning and growing. All I had to do is to take the bold step by registering for the program and trusted the AVA team.

                My experience with Alfred & Victoria Associates was good one, i saw the job ad publication online (2018), i applied, and was later called for screening at the office. I had a chat with thier staff who enlightened me and told me about the program. I was convinced and i paid for the program, but unfortunately i couldnâ€™t attend. A few days later, got a job invite from mainone cable as a sales executive. I took the written test and an oral interview, passed and was told to resume work the following week. Am really grateful for the WDD 2.0 platform, though i condnt attend the program but got the job through alfred and victoria associates and get me a job service. I am not longer with mainone cable but this event provided me with an opportunity to work with multinational institution and also set up a road map for my career.

                Attending WDD 2.0 was one of my cherished moments in 2018. I was a fresh graduate awaiting NYSC and I was currently looking for a Job. I attended this career seminar and it was a life-changing experience for me. I learnt a lot about how to answer interview questions, LinkedIn optimization amongst other things. I got a lot more than the 3000 paid for the event as it was well coordinated, beautiful refreshments, networking and Job opportunities. To top it all, I got my first job through Alfred and Victoria Associate few weeks after the event. I strongly advise every young graduate and undergraduate to attend this next edition of the event.
